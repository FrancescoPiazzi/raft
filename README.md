# Raft Consensus Algorithm in Rust

This repository is an implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Rust. The Raft algorithm is a distributed consensus algorithm designed for fault-tolerant systems. It provides a way for a cluster of nodes to agree on a sequence of values, even in the presence of failures.

## Features

- Leader election: The algorithm elects a leader among the nodes in the cluster.
- Log replication: The leader replicates its log entries to other nodes in the cluster.
- Safety: The algorithm ensures that only a single leader is active at any given time.
- Fault tolerance: The algorithm can tolerate failures of nodes in the cluster.
